## 🔐 Privacy-First Architecture

CapSecure leverages Zama's FHE technology to create a truly private equity management system:

### 🛡️ What Gets Encrypted

- **Investor Holdings**: Ownership percentages remain private
- **Transaction Amounts**: Equity transfers are confidential
- **Vesting Schedules**: Vesting amounts stay encrypted
- **Reputation Scores**: Investor/company reputation is private
- **Financial Data**: All sensitive financial information is protected

### 🔄 How It Works
